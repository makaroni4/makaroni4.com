        <p>
          Spring is coming to Berlin and it's an absolutely beautiful morning. I made a cup of coffee, did some spinning, watched a Warriors game and I'm full speed on taking <a href="https://github.com/sqlhabit/sql-mdn-docs">SQL MDN Docs</a> off the ground.
        </p>

        <p>
          Discovered a <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/podcast">Dwarkesh Podcast</a>. Great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTogNUV3CAI">episode with Demis Hassabis</a>. Everybody is talking about AI and it's crazy to think that in a few years AI fantasies from Ender's Game, Her, etc will become a reality.

          Will all "computer professions" become obsolete? Will universal basic income become a thing? Will we see a truly efficient market?
