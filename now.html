        <h3>Books</h3>

        <p>
          Just finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18777524">Ender's Game quintet</a>, the best Sci-Fi I've read. The quintet (what a word) is about many things, but it is largely about <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xenocide">Xenocide</a> â€“ "the killing or attempted killing of an entire alien species". Sadly, it brings a lot of thoughts given what's going on in the world.

        <p>
          Atm I'm reading [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659). It's so strange to read a stranger's diary. Way weireder that this stranger was a Roman Emperor and he wrote it 1843 years ago. A lot of great thoughts on what it means to live a good life, Stoicism, death, etc.

        <h3>Creativity</h3>

        <p>I'm building a new dataset for <a href="https://www.sqlhabit.com/">SQL Habit</a>, it'll be a real data about Earth: population of countries, CO2 emissions, number of cars, etc.</p>
