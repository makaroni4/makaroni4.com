Drug addiction is horrible.

Michael Brody-Waite is a drug addict turned CEO.

In rehab, drug addicts are taught to follow these 3 principles to avoid relapse:

1. Rigorous authenticity.
2. Surrender the outcome.
3. Do uncomfortable work no matter what.

Very same principles make great leaders.

## Be authentic

The alternative to authenticity is wearing a mask. Who are you trying to impress?

Don't like on your resume. Don't sugar coat that email.

Show vulnerability, be humble, just be yourself.

From a drug addict perspective: "It's about whether you want to stay clean".

> I found freedom of just wearing my face.

There's a study that says 60% of adults can't go 10 minutes without a lie. We're living in a world that practices the opposite of authenticity.

## Surrender the outcome

Don't obsess over outcomes you can't control.

## Do uncomfortable work no matter what

Don't hide the hard truth.

[Extreme Ownership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership) book immediately comes to mind.

> Question from the interview: What's one of your greatest weaknesses?

Great candidates should be authentic to share a real one, not "I buy too many shoes".

And he delivered the talk wearking flip flops. ❤️
